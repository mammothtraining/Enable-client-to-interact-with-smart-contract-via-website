https://youtu.be/zOBPAyhkIHo

Use JavaScript to connect to your Solidity smart contract in a Truffle project. Enable a client to visit your front-end website and use the MetaMask crypto wallet to perform transactions on a local Blockchain network (Ganache). 

This way, a website visitor can interact with the blockchain via your dapp! (Decentralized web app)
